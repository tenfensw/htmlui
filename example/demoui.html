  <div>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>As you can see, this is a HTML page that is rendered by HTMLUI and, as such, can call Ruby code.</p>
	<p>How do you do that? Well, for example, if you have a Ruby function <code>foo</code> that you want to call when clicking on a link, you just put <code>rb:foo</code> inside the <code>href</code> tag of the link. And the next time you click it, <code>foo</code> will be called.</p>
	<p>This example does actually have a function called <code>sayhello</code> and it will be called if you click the button below:</p>
	<a href="rb:sayhello" class="ui-btn">Greet me!</a>
